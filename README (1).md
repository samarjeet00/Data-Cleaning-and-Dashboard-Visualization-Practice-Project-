# Data Cleaning and Dashboard Visualization { Practice Project }

## 📊 Project Overview

This is a practice project focused on developing and enhancing data cleaning and data visualization skills. The workflow involves collecting a dataset from Kaggle, cleaning and preprocessing the data using Google Sheets, and finally importing it into Power BI to create an interactive and insightful dashboard.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Practice data cleaning techniques using Google Sheets
- Understand and apply basic data transformation logic
- Develop an interactive dashboard using Power BI
- Gain hands-on experience in end-to-end data handling

---

## 🧾 Data Source

- **Platform:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  
  -this is the practic project i dont have the dataset koow but you can easily found out at kaggle.


## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Google Sheets)

Steps performed in Google Sheets:
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values
- Standardized date and text formats
- Corrected inconsistent entries
- Applied basic formulas for calculations

---

## 📈 Data Visualization (Power BI)

Tasks completed in Power BI:
- Imported cleaned dataset from Google Sheets
- Created meaningful KPIs and metrics
- Developed interactive charts (bar, line, pie, etc.)
- Used slicers and filters for dynamic insights
- Designed an intuitive layout for better user experience

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Google Sheets:** Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and visualization
- **Kaggle:** Data source

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Open the file in Google Sheets and perform cleaning
3. Save the cleaned version as a CSV or connect directly with Power BI
4. Open Power BI and load the data
5. Use the Power BI file (`.pbix`) to explore the visualizations

## 📌 Notes

This project is meant for learning and practice purposes. No real-world decisions should be made based on the data or dashboard unless further validated.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Raw datasets available from open sources like Kaggle often contain inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues that make them difficult to analyze directly. 

Moreover, converting cleaned data into meaningful visual stories can be challenging for beginners due to the complexity of visualization tools and lack of a structured workflow.

---

## ✅ Solution

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective workflow to handle messy datasets and convert them into actionable insights:

1. **Data Collection** – The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Google Sheets is used to clean and preprocess the data through manual review and formulas.
3. **Data Visualization** – Power BI is used to build a creative, interactive dashboard that presents insights clearly and effectively.

This practice reinforces core data skills: cleaning, transformation, visualization, and storytelling.
